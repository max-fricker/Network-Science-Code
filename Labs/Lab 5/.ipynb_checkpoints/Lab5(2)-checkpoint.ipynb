    "### Numerical solution of an initial value problem\n",
    "When analyzing dynamics on networks, we frequently work with systems of ordinary differential equations (one equation for each node). The graph diffusion equation is a system of linear constant coefficient equations which can be solved in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian. Such an approach will not work for variable-coefficient and nonlinear ODEs which often arise when working with complex systems. Instead, we can use computational routines which take the initial condition as input and compute approximate solutions at later times. In this lab, you will use the *solve_ivp* function to solve a system of two equations. These equations have an analytical solution (which you should find and then use to test your numerical result), but keep in mind that the same approach could be used for more complicated equations."
