    "**Note on solve_ivp:** *solve_ivp* generates approximate numerical solutions for systems of ODEs using one of several available variable time step methods. The solutions are computed moving forward from the initial condition one time step at a time. Each iteration, the length of the time step is set so that an estimated error falls below a given threshold (smaller time steps tend to correspond to more accurate solutions). We can assume that all of the available methods have been implemented efficiently, and there is no one method that works best for all IVPs. For systems of nonlinear ODEs, the BDF method is usually a good choice."
